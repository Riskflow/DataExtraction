This a layer to make reading data from a database or a csv a pleasue.
It has a SQL-esque feel to it.

Any comments, critisims or ideas welcome.

The aim is to:
	1. Increase readablity of import routine
	2. When working with a db that is undergoing active development, to make handling any changes in the Dyalog side as simple as possible
	3. If testing in a file format such as CSV or XL, allowing the switch to a db as simple as possible
